Welcome to FlameCat - your fiery companion for document classification! :fire::cat:

FlameCat is a powerful machine learning project designed to categorize text documents into distinct categories using the intensity of flames. This classifier harnesses the heat of infernos to swiftly and accurately sort documents into their appropriate categories.

## Dataset

FlameCat uses the [Text Document Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sunilthite/text-document-classification-dataset) from Kaggle. This dataset contains 2225 text documents categorized into five different categories: politics, sports, technology, entertainment, and business.
